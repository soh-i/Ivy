Description: Ivy: software package for detection of RNA editing sites based on high-throughput sequencing data.
        ====
        
        Ivy is a software package that faster and accurately detects RNA editing events in higher eukaryotes (such as human, mouse, and melanogaster) RNA-seq data.
        
        Ivy includes 2 command line tools:
        
        * `ivy` is detection tool for RNA editing site.
        * `edit_bench` is benchmark tool to test the detection accuracy.
        
        
        # System requirements
        * Python 2.7+ (v2.7.5 recomended)
        * Unix like operating system (tested by OS X 10.9 and RedHat)
        
        # Dependencies
        The required dependencies to install the Ivy is `pysam`, `pyVCF`, `fisher`, and `matplotlib`.
        
        # Installation
        ```
        pip install numpy
        pip install matplotlib
        python setup.py install
        ```
